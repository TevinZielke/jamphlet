## Updating Project Configuration

Within the Project menu, users can easily update various aspects of the project's configuration. This functionality provides flexibility and customization options to ensure the project settings align with specific requirements.

## Item Schema Configuration

In the "Item Schema" subpage, users will find a configuration form where they can define how the project's items are represented. This includes attributes, categories, and the template form used when creating a new item. The schema determined here plays a crucial role in maintaining consistency and structure across all project items.

## Project Structure

The project structure dictates which sections are rendered on the client's personal webpage and their order. Each section can contain one or multiple components, providing a versatile and dynamic layout. The available components include:

- **Text Component:** Display text information.
- **Image Component:** Display a single image.
- **Text and Image Component:** Combine text and image in a single section.
- **Sticky Text Component with Multiple Images:** Present a sticky text element alongside multiple images.
- **Comparison Component:** Allow users to compare items against each other.

This modular approach ensures a tailored and engaging presentation of project information on the client's webpage.
