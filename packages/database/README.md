# Database Readme

## Schema Definition - schema.ts
The `schema.ts` file defines the schema in a DrizzleORM file. It serves as the blueprint for your data structure. Zod objects are generated from this file, ensuring type safety and consistency in your application.

## Database Configuration - database.ts
In the `database.ts` file, the Supabase connection pooler is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL database. This establishes the connection between your application and the database, allowing seamless interaction and data retrieval.

## Server-side Actions - actions folder
The `actions` folder contains Next.js server actions. These actions facilitate server-side CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without exposing sensitive material to the client side. This enhances the security of your application by keeping certain operations restricted to the server.

## Storage Configuration - storage.ts
The `storage.ts` file is responsible for configuring how media files are managed in the Supabase storage. It includes the setup for uploads, which are authorized through temporary signed URLs. This mechanism ensures that only authorized entities can upload files to your storage, enhancing the overall security of your media management system.

## Type Definitions - types.ts
The `types.ts` file serves as a configuration of all the necessary types for a type-safe development experience. It defines the structure and relationships between different data types, promoting a robust and error-free coding environment.
